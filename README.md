This webpage will allow you to take the place of a Major League Baseball general manager. You will be able to evaluate the consequences of potential free agent signings, trades, and releases on the team of your choice.

The app uses an external API, as well as a custom back-end built with C#/.Net, and React-Router on the front-end.
